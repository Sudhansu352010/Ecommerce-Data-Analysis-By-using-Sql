# Problem Statement

To conduct an in-depth analysis of E-commerce data and gain valuable insights, we will utilize SQL queries to extract key metrics 
such as Profits, highest sales, new customers, revenue, top-selling products, and highest profit margins from the database. 
Using this data, we will create an interactive and visually appealing PowerBi dashboard to showcase significant trends and 
performance indicators. The dashboard will offer a comprehensive view of the E-commerce performance, 
highlighting essential insights that can drive strategic decision-making and optimize business operations.
